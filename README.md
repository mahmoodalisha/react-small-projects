# React Small Projects

This repository contains a collection of small React projects that I created to enhance my understanding of React and its ecosystem. Each project focuses on different aspects of React, helping me to gain practical experience and deepen my knowledge of the library.

## Projects Included

1. **To-Do App using Context API**
   - A simple to-do application that leverages the Context API for state management. This project helped me understand how to share state across different components without prop drilling.

2. **To-Do App using Props**
   - A basic to-do application that uses props for state management and data passing between components. This project was my introduction to handling state and props in React.

3. **Background Changer**
   - An interactive app that allows users to change the background color of the app with a click of a button. This project helped me grasp event handling and state management in React.

4. **Comments and Reply App**
   - A comment box app where users can write comments, post them, and other users can reply to those comments. This project was instrumental in understanding the concept of nested components and managing complex state.

5. **Form Validation App**
   - A form with various input fields and built-in validation. This project helped me learn about form handling, validation, and error management in React.

6. **Password Hide-Show App**
   - A simple app that allows users to toggle the visibility of a password input field. This project taught me about conditional rendering and managing component state.

7. **React Clock**
   - A digital clock created using React. This project was my first introduction to working with intervals and updating the UI dynamically in React.

## How to Run the Projects

Each project is located in its own directory within this repository. To run any of the projects:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-small-projects.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd react-small-projects/project-name
npm install
npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the project.

Learnings and Insights
Working on these small projects helped me:

Understand the basics of React components, props, and state.
